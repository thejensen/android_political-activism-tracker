# android_political-activism-tracker

#### _...is a work in progress!_
The Political Activism Tracker will organize political action opportunities in one place from various sources. Users may also track their actions to keep a log of their efforts.  By organizing information, tracking actions, and setting reminders that there are new actions available, the PAT can encourage ongoing political activism.

## Known Bugs

#### Functional bugs

* No known bugs yet.

#### UX bugs

* Add form is weird, would like it in a dialog fragment.

#### Future Development

* Implement Search in-app (See: https://developer.android.com/training/app-indexing/deep-linking.html#adding-filters)
* Depending on the issues you care about (e.g. environment, civil rights, housing, international affairs), the app would suggest tasks to actively support them.
* Tasks include: 
Vote, 
Go to a Meetup, 
Protest, 
Read a piece of legislation, 
Call your congressman, 
Read an article,  
Share an article
* Each task would connect the user directly with the resource needed to complete the task (e.g. congresspersonâ€™s phone number, link to article, link to meetup).
